# Software Construction Project
This is an updated version of the code from **HBV202G Assignment 8** to complete the tasks in **HBV202G Assignment 11/ Software Construction Project**.  
It provides a simple implementation of a school library system that allows for book borrowing, tracking, and managing user data.

This project was built as part of the HBV202G course and includes:

-  Proper use of **Git** for version control and collaboration.
-  **Maven** usage including:
  - `compile`
  - `test`
  - `exec:java`
  - `package`
  - `site`
- **JUnit tests** for verifying business logic (non-UI related).
-  **UML Class Diagram** for system architecture.
-  Use of common **Design Patterns**:
  - Composite Pattern
  - Observer Pattern
-  Applied **Refactoring** principles for cleaner, maintainable code.
-  Packaged application as a **.jar** file.
-  Full **documentation** support:
  - `LICENSE`
  - `README.md`
  - Javadoc for all public and package-visible methods
  - Maven site generation and integration with design documentation


## Project overview

The project implements a basic library system with features like:
- Book borrowing and returning functionality
- Management of book authors and user roles (Faculty, Student)
- Exception handling for various error cases (e.g., book or user not found)
- System for tracking borrowed books and their due dates.

This project serves as a foundation for exploring concepts like object-oriented programming, design patterns, and software construction best practices.

### Design Features
- **User Management**: Includes different user roles (`Student`, `FacultyMember`), where each has its own behavior.
- **Book Management**: Users can borrow and return books, and the system tracks each book's availability.
- **Error Handling**: Custom exceptions are used to handle cases like missing users or books in the system.


## Project Structure

The project follows the typical Maven directory layout:

### `src/main/java/is/hi/kas108/hbv202g/assignment11`:
- **`Author.java`**: Contains the `Author` class and its implementations.
- **`Book.java`**: Contains the `Book` class, which extends the `LibraryItem` class and its implementations.
- **`EmptyAuthorListException.java`**: Custom exception thrown when the author list is empty and extends `Exception`.
- **`FacultyMember.java`**: Contains the `FacultyMember` class, which extends the `User` class and its implementations.
- **`Lending.java`**: Contains the `Lending` class that manages the borrowing of books.
- **`LibraryItem.java`**: Abstract class representing a item (either `Book` or `Omnibus`).
- **`LibraryLogger.java`**: Contains the `LibraryLogger` class, which extends the `LibraryObserver` and its implementations.
- **`LibraryObserver.java`**: Interface for implementing the Observer design pattern. It defines how observers receive updates.
- **`LibrarySystem.java`**: Core class for managing the library, handling operations like borrowing, returning, and searching for books.
- **`Main.java`**: Entry point for the program where the system is run and throws `EmptyAuthorListException`
- **`Omnibus.java`**: Contains the `Omnibus` class, which extends the `LibraryItem` class and its implementations.
- **`Student.java`**: Contains the `Student` class, which extends the `User` class and its implementations.
- **`User.java`**: Abstract class representing a user (either `Student` or `FacultyMember`).
- **`UserOrBookDoesNotExistException.java`**: Custom exception thrown when a user or book is not found in the system and extends `Exception`.


### `src/test/java/is/hi/kas108/hbv202g/assignment11`:
- **`AuthorTest.java`**: Test cases for the `Author` class.
- **`BookTest.java`**: Test cases for the `Book` class.
- **`FacultyMemberTest.java`**: Test cases for the `FacultyMember` class.
- **`LendingTest.java`**: Test cases for the `Lending` class.
- **`LibraryItemTest.java`**: Test cases for the `LibraryItem` class.
- **`LibrarySystemTest.java`**: Test cases for the `LibrarySystem` class.
- **`MainTest.java`**: Test cases for the `Main` class.
- **`OmnibusTest.java`**: Test cases for the `Omnibus` class.
- **`UserTest.java`**: Test cases for the `User` class.



## How to Install and Run

### Prerequisites:
- Java **17** or higher
- Maven **3.6** or higher

### Steps to Install and Run:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/katrin108/hbv202g_lokaV.git
    cd hbv202g_lokaV
    ```

2. **To compile the project**, run:
    ```bash
    mvn compile
    ```

3. **To run the tests**, use:
    ```bash
    mvn test
    ```

4. **To run the main application**, execute:
    ```bash
    mvn exec:java
    ```

5. **To package the application** (create a JAR file):
    ```bash
    mvn package
    ```

6. **To generate the project's site documentation**, use:
    ```bash
    mvn site
    ```

This will execute the `main` method in `Main.java` demonstrates how to use the `LibrarySystem` class.

## Usage

The `main` method in `Main.java` demonstrates the usage of the `LibarySystem` class. You can view the results in the terminal after running the application.

## Testing

JUnit is used to test core components of the business logic. Coverage includes:

- `LibrarySystem`: Borrowing logic and exception handling
- `Book`, `Omnibus`, and `Lending`: Composite behavior and item management
- Observer pattern: Validates that `LibraryLogger` receives notifications

    ```bash
    mvn test
    ```


## Design Patterns Used

### Composite Pattern
Used for representing books and omnibus collections. Both `Book` and `Omnibus` extend `LibraryItem`, allowing uniform treatment for borrowing and returning.

### Observer Pattern
`LibraryLogger` implements `LibraryObserver` and gets notified whenever a book or omnibus is borrowed. This demonstrates decoupling between business logic and notification systems.
